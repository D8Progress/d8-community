## 🌟 What is D8 Progress?

**D8 Progress** (pronounced "Deliberate Progress") is a gamified goal and task tracking app specifically designed for neurodivergent minds. Unlike traditional productivity apps that assume habits become automatic, D8 Progress provides ongoing dopamine rewards and forgiveness-first mechanics.

### 🧠 Built for Neurodivergent Brains

- **ADHD-friendly**: Constant rewards, not just "check the box"
- **Autism-friendly**: Flexible structures, no forced social features
- **Forgiveness-first**: Streak shields prevent shame spirals
- **Choice-driven**: Pick your level of gamification (minimal to full RPG)

### ✨ Key Features

- 🎮 **Optional gamification**: XP, levels, achievements, or just simple tracking
- 🛡️ **Streak shields**: 2 per month to protect your progress when life happens
- 🎭 **Party system**: Transform goals into characters you level up (optional)
- 📊 **Flexible objectives**: Simple lists, milestones, habits, or checklists
- 🏆 **Sustainable motivation**: Built for long-term success, not quick fixes

**🧠 Neurodivergent-First Design**
Every feature is evaluated through the lens of ADHD, autism, and other neurodivergent experiences.

**🤝 Forgiveness Over Perfection**
We design for humans who have bad days, executive dysfunction, and life interruptions.

**🎮 Choice in Gamification**
Some people love RPG mechanics, others just want simple tracking. You choose your experience.

**🔒 Privacy Matters**
Your goals and progress are yours. We don't sell data or force social features.
